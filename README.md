# Brisbane-arboviruses-metadata
Long-term co-circulation of multiple arboviruses in southeast Australia revealed by xeno-monitoring and metatranscriptomics
Vieira et al. (2024) - in preparation. Metadata used in the phylogenetic analyses.

All files contain three documents:
1. Alignment produced with all near complete genomes, with at least 10,000 nucleotides, extracted from ViPR http://www.viprbrc.org/ (Pickett et al., 2012) on 10 September 2023, aligned using MAFFT v7 http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/ (Katoh et al., 2019), and edited in AliView v1.26 (Larsson, 2014). Files in .fasta
2. Alignment treated for the production of molecular clock in .fasta
3. Metadata in .txt

- genome names format: >Virus_name|NCBI_code|species_from_which_the_virus_was_isolated|name_of_the_sequence|AustralianState_City|Year_Month_Day
PS:sequences from other countries have the name of the country instead, these are: Fiji, PNG (Papua_New_Guinea), American_Samoa, Cook_Islands, and Malaysia
Australian states are abbreviated as: NSW (New South Wales), QLD (Queensland), SA (South Australia), TS (Torres Strait Islands), VIC (Victoria), WA (Western Australia).

When location in Australia was unknown, only Australia was written as location.

When precise location on the state was unknow, only State was mentioned.

When precise date was unknown, only year (or year and month) was mentioned.
